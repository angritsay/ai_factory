üí° Original Prompt

Build a web application for collaborative startup idea evaluation using AI agents.

‚∏ª

üîß Core Requirements
 1. Frontend (React preferred):
 ‚Ä¢ Input field for the user to enter a raw startup idea or thought fragment.
 ‚Ä¢ Field to enter an OpenAI API key. Store the key in localStorage.
 ‚Ä¢ Budget selector (in USD) to limit total OpenAI API usage for the evaluation session.
 ‚Ä¢ Real-time (or staged) UI showing agent conversations.
 ‚Ä¢ Final summary section with:
 ‚Ä¢ Structured startup pitch.
 ‚Ä¢ Investment verdict.
 ‚Ä¢ Option to view the entire conversation history.
 2. Backend (Node.js, FastAPI, or Flask):
 ‚Ä¢ Receives raw user input and budget.
 ‚Ä¢ Launches a chain of AI agents with clearly defined roles:
 1. Clarifier Agent ‚Äî Reformulates and interprets the idea.
 2. Critic Agent ‚Äî Acts as an investor. Challenges the idea on feasibility, logic, and market potential.
 3. Defender Agent ‚Äî Responds to critique, elaborates and improves the idea without user help.
 4. Investor Agent ‚Äî Evaluates the final version and makes a decision whether to ‚Äúinvest‚Äù or not. Generates a clear Markdown summary.
 ‚Ä¢ The conversation runs in cycles (e.g. 3‚Äì5 rounds max) or until API budget is exhausted.
 ‚Ä¢ Logs all agent messages for the frontend to display.
 ‚Ä¢ Supports a setting to limit OpenAI token usage by price ($ cost estimate via tiktoken or OpenAI usage API).
 3. Agent Instructions (System Prompts):
 ‚Ä¢ Must be defined clearly and separately for each agent.
 ‚Ä¢ Critic agent must be skeptical, precise, realistic.
 ‚Ä¢ Defender agent must be optimistic but reasonable, enhancing the idea constructively.
 ‚Ä¢ Investor agent must simulate a real angel investor with concerns about market size, traction, execution risk.

üéØ Goals
 ‚Ä¢ Minimal user interaction after idea input.
 ‚Ä¢ Autonomous agent dialog without manual intervention.
 ‚Ä¢ Highly readable final output: Startup summary + Investment verdict.
 ‚Ä¢ Simple, clean UI (no authentication needed, single-page app).

‚∏ª

üß† Notes
 ‚Ä¢ Use OpenAI Chat API (gpt-4o or gpt-4) for agent interactions.
 ‚Ä¢ Consider token costs, maintain total cost under the provided budget.
 ‚Ä¢ Each agent can be a function with reusable prompt templates.
 ‚Ä¢ Allow easy switching of models in the backend (e.g. gpt-4 ‚Üî gpt-3.5).
 ‚Ä¢ You may stub API calls or conversation generation for the UI first and plug in OpenAI logic later.
